# Python 12 is the main version despite profile settings

*/* PYTHON_TARGETS: -* python3_12
*/* PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET: -* python3_12



# Safer upgrade procedure
# =======================
# A safer approach is to add Python 3.13 support to your system first,
# and only then remove Python 3.12.  However, note that this involves two
# rebuilds of all the affected packages, so it will take noticeably
# longer.
# 
# First, enable both Python 3.12 and Python 3.13, and then run the upgrade
# commands:
#
#     */* PYTHON_TARGETS: -* python3_12 python3_13
#     */* PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET: -* python3_12
#
# Then switch PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET and run the second batch of upgrades:
#
#     */* PYTHON_TARGETS: -* python3_12 python3_13
#     */* PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET: -* python3_13
#
# Finally, switch to the final version and upgrade:
# 
#     */* PYTHON_TARGETS: -* python3_13
#     */* PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET: -* python3_13
